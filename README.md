# Migrating a Java Applet to HTML5

This project is a proof or concept demonstrating that it is possible to migrate an existing Java Applet to a true HTML5 application. The migrated applet is a simple [calculator applet](https://github.com/cincheo/applet-migration-example/blob/master/src/main/java/applet/AppletExample.java) that was found on the Internet.

## How does it work?

We use [JSweet](http://www.jsweet.org) and the [J4TS](https://github.com/cincheo/j4ts) library to transpile the Java code to JavaScript code.

This migration technique has several advantages:
- The Java code is compiled "as is" to plain JavaScript code that can run in any browser.
- There is no VM and no emulation.
  - It means no overhead compared to JavaScript.
  - Also, JavaScript APIs can be accessed directly, which is important for actual modernization.
- The modernized applet is not only better looking, but the code is also more maintainable (view/logic separation).
- One can switch its code base to the generated TypeScript or JavaScript, but can also remain in Java.
- This technique can also apply to plain AWT/Swing and SWT desktop applications.

## How to launch

Just clone the project and open the applet version you want to try with your favorite browser.
- [webapp/index.html](https://github.com/cincheo/applet-migration-example/blob/master/webapp/index.html) to open the original applet (only in Firefox and you must configure Java to allow local applets).
- [webapp/index-no-applet.html](https://github.com/cincheo/applet-migration-example/blob/master/webapp/index-no-applet.html) to open the JavaScript version of the applet compiled with JSweet (any browser).
- [webapp/index-no-applet-modernized.html](https://github.com/cincheo/applet-migration-example/blob/master/webapp/index-no-applet-modernized.html) to open a modernized version separating the applet's logic and the HTML view.
- [index-no-applet-modernized-bootstrap.html](https://github.com/cincheo/applet-migration-example/blob/master/webapp/index-no-applet-modernized-bootstrap.html) to open a better-looking HTML5 version using the Bootstrap framework.

## How to build

You need to have Node.js and Maven installed.

```
> mvn clean generate-sources
```
